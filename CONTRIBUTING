# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in the Oregon Statutes Archive (OSA).

OSA is an archival and formatting project focused on preserving and presenting the Oregon Revised Statutes in accessible, structured formats. Contributions are limited to maintaining accuracy, clarity, and fidelity to the source material.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

Contributions may be considered for the following:

- Correction of transcription or formatting errors  
- Fixes to broken structure, numbering, or references  
- Improvements that increase readability without altering meaning  
- Updates reflecting changes to the official statutory text  

All proposed changes must preserve the original statutory language and intent.

## What Contributions Are Not Accepted

OSA does not accept contributions that include:

- Legal interpretation, commentary, or analysis  
- Advocacy, opinion, or policy arguments  
- Stylistic rewrites that alter statutory meaning  
- Additions not present in the official statutory text  
- Content unrelated to the Oregon Revised Statutes  

Pull requests that fall outside the scope of archival accuracy may be declined without explanation.

## Source Verification

Contributors are expected to reference official Oregon statutory sources when proposing changes.  
Where applicable, citations or links to the relevant official publication should be included in the pull request description.

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed at the discretion of the repository maintainer.  
Acceptance of a contribution does not imply endorsement of any interpretation or use.

OSA reserves the right to modify, reject, or revert contributions to preserve archival integrity.

## Questions and Issues

If you believe an error exists but are unsure how to propose a correction, please open an issue with a clear description and reference to the official source.
