# Methodology

This document describes the general methodology used by the Oregon Statutes Archive (OSA) to organize and present statutory material.

The goal of OSA is to improve accessibility and navigability of the Oregon Revised Statutes while preserving the original statutory language and structure.

## Source Material

All statutory text is derived from public domain sources published by the State of Oregon.

OSA does not originate statutory content and does not modify the legal substance of the material.

## Preservation of Statutory Language

- Statutory wording is preserved as published  
- No substantive edits, paraphrasing, or interpretation are introduced  
- Formatting changes are limited to structure and readability  

Where formatting adjustments are made, care is taken to avoid altering meaning, emphasis, or legal effect.

## Structural Organization

To improve reference and navigation, statutes may be:

- Segmented into logical sections or subsections  
- Presented with consistent spacing and indentation  
- Organized into files or folders reflecting statutory hierarchy  

Numbering, headings, and ordering follow the official statutory structure unless otherwise required for clarity.

## Formatting Conventions

Formatting choices are applied consistently across the archive and may include:

- Line breaks to improve readability  
- Clear separation of subsections and paragraphs  
- Plain-text or lightweight markup formats for longevity and portability  

No typographical emphasis is added to suggest interpretation or priority.

## Versioning and Updates

Statutory material may be updated to reflect amendments, repeals, or reorganizations in the official statutes.

OSA does not guarantee real-time updates and may lag behind official publications.

Historical versions may be preserved where feasible.

## Error Handling

If errors are identified, corrections are made
